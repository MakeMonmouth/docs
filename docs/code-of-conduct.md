## Community Code of Conduct
All members are required to agree with the following code of conduct. All members of the community are expected to enforce this code at every event, with help from the directors. We expect cooperation from all participants in the community to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

# Need Help?
The contact details of the directors are on our website and in any emails we have sent.

# The Quick Version
Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any community event, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from any event or online forum without a refund (if applicable), or from the community itself, at the discretion of the directors.

# The Less Quick Version
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the directors may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event or community with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. All of our directors' contact details are listed on our website.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all community events.
