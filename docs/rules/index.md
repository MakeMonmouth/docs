# The rules of the space!

The following pages set out the rules of the space, including what to do if the rules are breached or need amending.

It boils down to some very simple concepts:

1. Be kind to everyone
2. Share the tools and resources
3. If someone is doing something dangerous, ask them to stop
4. If you don't know how to use a particular tool or piece of equipment, ask for help
