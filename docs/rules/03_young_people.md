# Young People

## Summary

At Wye Make, we prioritize the safety and inclusivity of all members and visitors, including young people. To ensure the safety of everyone in our space, all individuals under 18 years old must be accompanied by a responsible adult. The responsible adult will be accountable for the safety and behavior of the young person they are accompanying.

## GCSE Age and Above

We welcome young people who have started their GCSEs to bring their coursework or projects to our space and use the tools available after completing the necessary inductions. 

Although children of this age require supervision from their accompanying adult, we recognise that they are at an age where independence is significant. Hence, we allow them to learn how to operate the tools and machinery independently and safely.

## Younger Children

We allow children aged 12 and above in the space, acknowledging that it is a privilege rather than a right. However, if they disrupt others or fail to comply with our rules, they will be asked to leave. 

Any tools requiring induction, such as the 3D printer, must be used by the accompanying adult after they have undertaken the appropriate induction and/or training. 

If a child demonstrates the maturity required to undergo an induction before reaching GCSE age, we will consider it on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of our core team.
