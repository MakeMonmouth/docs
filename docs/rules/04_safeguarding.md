# Safeguarding

## Summary

Any safeguarding issues within the space can be reported confidentially by emailing [safeguarding@makemonmouth.co.uk](mailto:safeguarding@makemonmouth.co.uk).

The directors responsible for handling safeguarding issues are DBS Cleared and must remove themselves from any cases in which they could be seen to be biased.

Anyone found to be suspected of acting illegally or unlawfully in the space will be suspended with immediate effect and reported to the relevant authorities.

Whilst the law prevents us from demanding that members disclose any convictions that may relate to safeguarding issues, we will always take appropriate steps to ensure that all our members are safe and feel welcome.

These steps will often be on a case-by-case basis, and the decisions will remain confidential amongst those involved in any investigative process unless we are otherwise required to declare them by law.
