# Be Kind

This should go without saying.

Think about how you're approaching any given situation, reflect on whether your behaviour might upset the person or people you are approaching, and then act accordingly.

The Code of Conduct makes it very clear as to what is acceptable and what isn't, and we expect this behaviour to be adhered to at all of our meetups and events.

If you see someone acting in a way that is not within the Code of Conduct, please report them to one of the core team who will deal with the individual accordingly.
