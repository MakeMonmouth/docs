# Silhouette Cameo 4

The [Cameo 4](https://www.silhouetteamerica.com/cameo-4) is a desktop cutting machine for the modern maker.  With certain materials, you can now choose to cut from a mat or go completely matless using Cameo 4â€™s smart cutting technology. You can also cut directly from a roll using the built-in roll feeder and cross cutter. Cut out or sketch on dozens of materials such as vinyl, cardstock, fabric, and more.

You can easily cut vinyl, cardstock, crepe paper, foam, fabric, chipboard, leather, and more!
