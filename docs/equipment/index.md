# Available Equipment

Make Monmouth was setup to provide both a space and equipment for people in the local area to be more creative.

This section outlines the equipment we have and, where necessary, safety guidance for using that item.

If you'd like to make sure that a particular item is at the space for the next meeting, please either email us or post to #equipment-bookings on discord.

If you have any questions or queries, please raise it with one of the core members or email [info@makemonmouth.co.uk](mailto:info@makemonmouth.co.uk).
