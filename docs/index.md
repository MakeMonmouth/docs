## Make Monmouth Quick Start

New to Make Monmouth? Here's what you need to know:

### What is Make Monmouth?

Open to anyone in Monmouth and the surrounding areas, Make Monmouth is a space where you can create, design, tinker, and hack on your projects in the company of like-minded people.

If it helps, we want to end up as a combination of a [Hackspace](https://hackspace.org.uk), Art Studio, [Men's Shed](https://menssheds.org.uk/), arts, crafts, and electrical component shop, and Haberdashery which is open to anyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. (You can read more about this in our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).)

### Sounds great, how do I sign up?

Come along to one of our open evenings!

These are held on the first Tuesday of every month between 8pm and 10pm at [Woodland View Stores](https://goo.gl/maps/Yi4MGHwDJNM1N1ty5), Wyesham, Monmouth.

You'll be able to chat with our existing members, learn more about the membership levels and our plans for the future, and sign up to gain more frequent access to the space.

### What do I get as a member?

Membership benefits vary depending on which level you join at, and what we can provide will increase over time, however it roughly breaks down into the following:

* All Members
    * Access to the space on regular meeting nights
    * Discount on components from [PiMoRoNi](https://www.pimoroni.com/) via our "Hackspace Wholesale" account (any profits made go towards funding the space and new tools!)
    * A chance to access tools such as 3D printers and Sewing Machines without needing to purchase them yourself
    * Full access to our online Discord chat platform to keep the conversations going after the meetups have ended
* Part-time Members (£5/month)
    * Voting rights on some of the decisions that need to be made about the space
    * Able to request storage for "long-term" projects that are being actively worked on (No more struggling to fit it in the car each week!)
* Full-time members (£10/month)
    * Voting rights on most of the decisions that need to be made about the space
    * Priority access to storage for long-term projects being actively worked on
    * Early-access to tickets for events/workshops that we hope to put on for the local community
    * Able to request a key-holder open up the space if they are available (This won't come into effect until we have a space with 24hr access and is at the key-holder's discretion)

We also have "Core Members" - unlike the other membership levels, to become a Core Member you need to have been a part of Make Monmouth for at least 6 months and be willing to take on additional responsibilities such as being "on-call" for if an issue occurs, becoming a "key holder" to open up (when we get a space that we have access to 24x7x365), or even becoming a director of Make Monmouth CIC with all the legal implications that carries.

It is also assumed that Core members will be available to support the running of workshops and events, and will take part in raising awareness and funds for the organisation when needed.

Given that Core Members take on additional responsibilities, the membership fee remains at £10/month for these members however they also get the following benefits on top of their Full membership:

* Voting rights on all decisions that affect the running of the organisation and space
* Access to the space at all times
* Access to a dedicated "core membership" channel within our Discord community
* First refusal on storage space
* First refusal on tickets for events/workshops we organise
