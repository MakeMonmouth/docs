# Tackling Rural Isolation

!!! quote "" 

    Make Monmouth will provide somewhere for people to create in the company of others that is not their spare bedroom, dining table, or shed


17% of the Welsh population [consider themselves lonely](https://www.gov.wales/loneliness-and-isolation-rural-wales-ticking-time-bomb-huw-irranca-davies-0) according to the Welsh Government, with [younger people feeling more isolated than those who are older](https://www.gov.wales/tackling-loneliness-and-social-isolation-through-connected-communities).

We want to create a space where anyone from aged 12 onwards can come and express themselves regardless of identity, learning new skills and exploring their creativity as they grow.

Make Monmouth should provide somewhere for young people to build, create, and craft without fear of judgement from their peers

## How will we measure this?

Regular surveys and other engagements with our membership and visitors to understand if this is part of the reason they attend and, if it is, what effect Make Monmouth has on their sense of isolation.
