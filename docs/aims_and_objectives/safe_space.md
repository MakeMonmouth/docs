# Providing a safe space

!!! quote "" 

    Make Monmouth will be a safe, welcoming, and inclusive space for everyone, including those who are neurodiverse and/or are part of the LGBTQIA+ community


[3% of the population identify as as a member of the LGBTQIA+ community](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/three-percent-england-wales-identify-lesbian-gay-or-bisexual-census-2023-01-06/), of those, 46% have been subjected to abuse of some form in the past year.

We want to create a space where members of the LGBTQIA+ community can feel safe and welcome to express themselves through craft, art, and making without fear of judgement.

Our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) applies to all our online groups, physical meetings, and any other event that we organise, and failure to adhere to it is dealt with swiftly.


## How will we measure this?

Regular surveys and other engagements with our membership and visitors to understand their impressions of how inclusive we are.  Gathering this information is often tricky, as the less inclusive or safe a space feels, the less likely people are to respond to a survey on the topic, therefore we will also monitor the number of responses and use that as an indicator as to how we are doing.
